# Heal the Web Typeface
<h3>A typeface to heal the web</h3>

The font startet with a simple but big message: Heal the web with an experimental open source Typeface designed for everyone. Originally developed by <a href="https://rainbow-unicorn.com" target="_blank" >Rainbow Unicorn</a> for Mozilla’s <a href="https://2020.internethealthreport.org/" target="_blank" >Internet Health Report 2020</a> the lettering resembles circuits, connections and networks through Geometric Shapes sticking together like an abstract Puzzle.

While preserving the original edgy Character the goal became to create an entire Font with improved legibility and complex Lettering for typographic experiments.

<strong>Heal the Web A</strong> is best used for bodytext with improved legibility but still a very strong geometric edginess.

<strong>Heal the Web B</strong> stands out with its edgy typography, contains abstract Glyphs and is best used as an All Caps Font while the minuscules are a construction kit for further experiments. Unlike it’s other version it consist of strictly geometric shapes without optical correction.

Both Versions have collections of alternate Glyphs which originated from In-between steps of the design process. They are accessible through OpenTypes Stylistic sets.
